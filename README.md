# Book Finder SPA

## Overview

Book Finder is a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to search for their favorite books, read detailed descriptions, and leave comments on the books. Users can toggle between dark and light modes, and they can submit feedback using a "Contact Us" form. The application uses a `db.json` file to mock a server, storing book data and user comments.

## Features

- **Search Books**: Users can search for books using the search bar.
- **Comment Section**: Users can leave comments on individual books.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can toggle between light and dark modes for a personalized experience.
- **Contact Us Form**: A contact form where users can submit their feedback or inquiries. Submissions are mocked to be received by the Book Finder support department.
- **Mocked Data**: Book data is stored in a `db.json` file to simulate a server response.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing dynamic functionality and interactions.
- **JSON (db.json)**: For storing book data, comments, and user feedback in a mock database.
